## Feeling the hit
I’ve just come through two major crises back-to-back. In the moment, the intensity was overwhelming — but once resolved, I felt an unmistakable high pulsing through my body.<br>  
It was as if my veins carried relief, pride, and raw energy all at once. And yet, I know the next crisis could bring me crashing down.<br>
This cycle of highs and lows sparked my reflection on how dopamine shapes our response to crisis and resolution.  

## The High of Resolution  
When a crisis hits, our bodies go into high alert. Stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol sharpen our focus, while dopamine fuels motivation to act.<br>
In the thick of it, this cocktail gives us clarity and drive. When we succeed in resolving the crisis, dopamine surges.<br>
That “high in the veins” is a reward signal — a rush that reinforces our ability to overcome challenges.

## The Crash That Follows  
But every high has a low. Once the crisis passes and dopamine levels drop, the body downshifts.<br>
Fatigue, irritability, or emptiness can follow. This crash isn’t weakness — it’s biology rebalancing.<br>
Yet, repeated cycles of crisis and resolution can condition the brain to crave intensity, creating a dangerous loop.

## The Good, the Bad, the Ugly  
- **The Good:** Rising to the challenge builds resilience. Each resolved crisis strengthens confidence and skill.  
- **The Bad:** Dopamine cycles are costly. The crash can drain energy and mood.  
- **The Ugly:** Relying on crisis as a primary source of purpose risks burnout and emotional volatility.

## Finding Balance  
To manage the cycle more sustainably:  
- **Deliberate recovery:** Schedule downtime to let the nervous system reset.  
- **Anchor rewards:** Celebrate small wins outside of crisis moments.  
- **Awareness practice:** Recognize the pattern — knowing a crash is coming makes it easier to ride out.

Crisis will always bring intensity, but **balance comes from learning to cultivate steady sources of energy and reward outside of chaos.**
