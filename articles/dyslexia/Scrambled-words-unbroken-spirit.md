<p class="lede">Those are his words.<br>Not mine — his.</p>

<hr class="section-line">
If you’ve never lived with dyslexia, maybe it sounds small, even silly. *Just words mixed up on a screen.*<br>
<div class="struggle">But to me, it’s heartbreak.</div><br>Because I know the weight behind those lines. I’ve seen it my whole life.<br>  
I taught him to read when we were kids. I’ve always been his silent translator — the one who could untangle his meaning when the letters betrayed him.  
His scars run deep, and I know them all. *Life has not been kind.*  
<hr class="section-line">
A “special” school that never really saw him.<br>
Crap jobs that didn’t honor his worth.<br>
Years of scraping by when he deserved so much more.<br>
<div class="strength">He has built a life out of grit and persistence.</div><br>And yet — he endures. He manages. He thrives in his own way.<br>

<hr class="section-line">
He is a good man. A great human being. My best friend.<br>
From the outside, dyslexia doesn’t look dramatic. It looks like typos, like mistakes, like *“why don’t you just try harder.”*<br>
What people don’t see is the loop: type, scramble, erase, try again, give up, repeat.<br>
They don’t see the patience it takes to keep showing up.<br>
They don’t see the strength it takes to keep going.  
<hr class="section-line">
I see it. I have always seen it. And I want you to see it too.<br>
<div class="empathy">To my best friend: you are not defined by scrambled words.</div><br>You are defined by the way you keep showing up, no matter how many times the world told you “not enough.”<br>
You are defined by kindness, by courage, by the quiet power of refusing to fold.  

Your story is not just about dyslexia. *It’s about resilience.*<br>
And I am proud to stand beside you in it.
