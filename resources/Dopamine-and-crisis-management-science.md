## What Science Tells Us About Dopamine and Crisis Management

Research from neuroscience and psychology provides a framework for understanding why crises feel so intense â€” and why resolution produces such a powerful high.

- **Dopamine and motivation:** Studies show that dopamine is less about pleasure itself and more about *anticipation and action*. It spikes when we face high-stakes challenges, motivating us to act rather than sit still.

- **Stress and the crisis state:** During acute stress, the body releases cortisol and adrenaline, sharpening attention. Dopamine works alongside these chemicals to prioritize immediate action and reward survival-driven decisions.

- **The crash after resolution:** Once a crisis passes, dopamine and stress hormones fall. Research highlights how this can lead to temporary fatigue, low mood, or even a sense of emptiness.

- **The loop of intensity:** Habit-forming pathways in the brain can start linking dopamine release primarily to crisis-solving, creating a cycle where individuals seek â€” or even unconsciously create â€” high-pressure situations.
