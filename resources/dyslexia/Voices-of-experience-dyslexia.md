## 🗣️ Voices of Lived Experience — Dyslexia

> Direct words shared about what really helps:

1. 🌈 “I don’t know how it works – but if the words are *colourful*{: .dyslexia-calm}, it registers faster, the brain needs to think less.”  

2. 📖 “For people like me, black and white are the norm. When the words are *colourful*{: .dyslexia-encouragement}, they are better to read.”  

3. 🔍 “If I *select*{: .dyslexia-alert} a word on screen, then it must explain in plain language the meaning.”  

4. 🌍 “If I still don’t know, there must be a *language option*{: .dyslexia-neutral} to translate.”

💡 These reflections highlight practical needs:  
- **Color & font choices** make reading easier and faster.  
- **Plain-language explanations** help untangle meaning.  
- **Translation options** provide a safety net when words don’t land.  

Accessibility isn’t abstract — it’s lived. These are voices worth centering. 💙
