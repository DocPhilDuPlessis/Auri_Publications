## 🗣️ Voices of Lived Experience — Dyslexia

> Direct words shared about what really helps:

1. 🌈 *“I don’t know how it works – but if the words are colourful, it registers faster, the brain needs to think less.”*  
2. 📖 *“For people like me, black and white are the norm. WHen the words are colourful, they are better to read.”*  
3. 🔍 *“If I select a word on screen, then it must explain in plain language the meaning.”*  
4. 🌍 *“If I still don’t know, there must be a language option to translate.”*

💡 These reflections highlight practical needs:  
- **Color & font choices** make reading easier and faster.  
- **Plain-language explanations** help untangle meaning.  
- **Translation options** provide a safety net when words don’t land.  

Accessibility isn’t abstract — it’s lived. These are voices worth centering. 💙
