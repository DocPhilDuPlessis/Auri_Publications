## 💙 Helper’s Guide: Supporting a Friend with Dyslexia

> You don’t need to be a teacher. Support can be simple, gentle, and playful.  
> Here are ways to stand beside your friend and make words less heavy.

---

### 🌱 Day-to-day Supports
- Break words into small chunks together (*buddy decoding*).  
- Mirror back scrambled messages so he feels understood.  
- Encourage voice-to-text for messages to reduce frustration.  

---

### 🎨 Creative Aids
- Color-code syllables to make reading playful.  
- Use dyslexia-friendly fonts like **OpenDyslexic**.  
- Start with doodles or mind-maps before full sentences.  

---

### 🤝 Emotional Helpers
- Celebrate *meaning* over spelling — “I got what you meant.”  
- Frame assistive tools as **power-ups**, not crutches.  
- Be a safe space for venting without judgment.  

---

### 📚 Learning Boosters
- Try **Touch-Type Read & Spell (TTRS)** for bite-sized lessons.  
- Pair **audiobooks with text** to reinforce reading.  
- Use **text-to-speech apps** (Speechify, NaturalReader) so he can *hear* his own writing.

💡 **Remember:** keep it light, playful, and human.  
Your presence and patience matter more than perfect spelling.
