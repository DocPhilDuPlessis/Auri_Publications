# Mindfulness Practices for Crisis Professionals

High-stakes environments demand rapid decisions and intense focus. These
mindfulness techniques are designed to help professionals reset,
recover, and sustain resilience.

## 1. Grounding Breath (2 minutes)

-   Sit comfortably and close your eyes.
-   Inhale through the nose for a count of 4, hold for 2, exhale for 6.
-   Repeat for several cycles, focusing on the rhythm of your breath.

## 2. Body Scan (5 minutes)

-   Starting at the crown of your head, bring awareness slowly down the
    body.
-   Notice areas of tension without judgment, gently releasing as you
    exhale.
-   Move through shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, legs, and feet.

## 3. Micro-Moments of Awareness

-   Between tasks, pause for 30 seconds.
-   Name one thing you see, hear, and feel physically.
-   This anchors attention in the present and resets mental focus.

## 4. Compassion Break

-   When self-criticism arises, pause and silently repeat:
    -   "This is a moment of stress."
    -   "Stress is part of being human."
    -   "May I be kind to myself in this moment."

## 5. Walking Meditation (5--10 minutes)

-   Walk slowly in a quiet space, paying close attention to each step.
-   Feel the contact of your feet with the ground and the shifting of
    balance.
-   Let thoughts come and go without clinging.

These practices can be integrated into daily routines to build
resilience, prevent burnout, and enhance clarity during and after
crises.
